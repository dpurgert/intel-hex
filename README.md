# intel-hex
AVR parser for intel hex

If this works, long term plan is to make an EEPROM programmer.

## Documentation
Full documentation can be generated using doxygen on the included
Doxyfile (note, you will need to create a "docs" subdirectory first).
It is currently a work in progress, and for the moment, tracking the
docs is a waste of time and bandwidth.
